So i was playing around with google app scripts. Figure you can take a look and see what I did.

So, here's what I did:
I wrote three functions. The first one is called 'addTwoNumbers' which just adds two numbers passed in. Use it like so:
"=addTwoNumbers(2,3)"
The result should be "5"

The next function is called 'bigBob' and it just returns the statement "BigBob in da hizzy"
use it like so
"=bigBob()"

The last function I wrote is called 'fib'
fib will calculate the fibbanacci value for a number.
Fibbanacci is a mathematical sequence that starts off like this
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
basically to find the next number in sequence, you add the two numbers before. It's a beautifully mathematical function. And one of like the first functions you implement when learning a new language.
Here's how to call it: "=fib(10)"
and the result should be "55"

To see the actual code I wrote, click on "Tools" and then "Code
